This is a project with the implementation of common stochastic optimization methods on the example of the traveling salesman problem on Python v3.7+.

Required packages: `numpy (1.19.2+)`, `matplotlib (3.2.2+)`

Files:
* `searches.py` - file with the implementation of all searches
* `processing.py` - file with the secondary functions: generate and read the dataset, draw the salesman's path and launch the algorithm
* `Tests.ipynb` - jupyter notebook with the usage examples.
